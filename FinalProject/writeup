Goals:
  -Install and manage MySQL via Puppet on our master and agent node instances [done]
    The MySQL puppet forge module's documentation wasn't great, and searching online let us know that we weren't the only ones who've had trouble managing the latest version of MySQL via Puppet on Ubuntu 
    After our first attempt resulted in dozens of lines of red error messages and frusturating troubleshooting to no avail, a full purge, reboot, and reinstall solved the problem
  -Be able to use MySQL from any of the instances [done]
Test/verify:
  Successfully enter and retrieve data [done]
User support:
  Ideally this system makes managing MySQL less difficult than it otherwise would be, doing operations like editing user permissions
Security considerations:
  Default password after installing MySQL is "root" and so it needs to be changed
  mysql password in site.pp file can't be pushed to github
  in the future, instances with mysql could have their public ips removed and be accessed from instances with public IPs in the same subnet
User documentation:
  To install, you can do one of two things
    1) add "mod 'puppetlabs-mysql', '3.11.0'" to the puppet file
    or
    2)run "puppet module install puppetlabs-mysql --version 3.11.0"
  To uninstall, run "sudo puppet module uninstall puppetlabs-mysql"
