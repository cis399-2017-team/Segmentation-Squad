Goals:
  Install and manage MySQL via Puppet on our master and agent node instances
Test/verify:
  Successfully enter and retrieve data
User support:
  Ideally this system makes managing MySQL less difficult than it otherwise would be, doing operations like editing user permissions
Security considerations:
  mysql password in site.pp file can't be pushed to github
  in the future, instances with mysql could have their public ips removed and be accessed from instances with public IPs in the same subnet

User documentation:
  To install, you can do one of two things
  1) add "mod 'puppetlabs-mysql', '3.11.0'" to the puppet file
  or
  2)run "puppet module install puppetlabs-mysql --version 3.11.0"

  To uninstall, run "sudo puppet module uninstall puppetlabs-mysql"
